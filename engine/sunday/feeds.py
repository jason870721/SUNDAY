"""Information layer — batch-1 perp microstructure feeds (milestone-4 T1).

Sunday ingests funding / open-interest / basis per symbol from the exchange and
writes them to `perp_metrics` (modeling-grade). The agents reason over these
*normalised features* (via `/desk`) instead of raw firehose — controlling token
cost + quality, and giving the research desk the quant-credible signals that are
real edges on perps (funding reflexivity, OI build-up, basis stretch).

`derive_metrics` is PURE (annualisation + basis math), unit-testable without an
exchange. `fetch_perp_metrics`/`ingest_all` are the live edge (call exchange +
store). Liquidations / long-short ratio columns exist in the schema but are
best-effort None in batch-1 (testnet rarely serves them; wired for later/batch-2).
