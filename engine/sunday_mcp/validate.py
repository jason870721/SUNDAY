"""Cross-field validation for the write tools (PRD-9.3 §2, S7 stdlib-only).

These are the rules JSON Schema can't express. They run as pure functions
BEFORE any upstream call, so a rejected input has zero side effects, and each
validator returns ALL violations at once — the agent fixes everything in one
round trip, not one error per attempt.

Scope discipline (the drift guard from PRD-9.3 §6): only STRUCTURE lives here
— exactly-one, field pairing, relative direction. Anything that needs market
state (trigger fire zones, precision, limits) is the engine's job; the sidecar
holds no market view (S1), so those rules exist on exactly one side.
